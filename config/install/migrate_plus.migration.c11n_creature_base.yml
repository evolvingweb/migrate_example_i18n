# Migration of "article" node data from Drupal 7.
#
# This file demonstrates migration of content translated with
# the 'entity_translation' module.
#
# Since a detailed description of many configuration parameters
# has been provided in the 'hybrid_base' and 'hybrid_i18n' migrations,
# they have not been repeated here. Kindly refer to those migrations
# if you are looking for detailed descriptions for various paramters.

  # Ignoring translations! The tricky part!
  #
  # The Drupal 7 version of the migration source Node does not
  # support the "translations" parameter at this moment. Hence,
  # even if you specify "translations: flase" (or omit that line),
  # all nodes, including translations, are imported.
  #
  # To prevent this, I chose to write the method D7NodeEntityTranslation::query().
