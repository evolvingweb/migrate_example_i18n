# Migration of "article" node translations from Drupal 7.
#
# This file demonstrates migration of content translated with
# the 'entity_translation' module.
#
# Since a detailed description of many configuration parameters
# has been provided in the 'hybrid_base' and 'hybrid_i18n' migrations,
# they have not been repeated here. Kindly refer to those migrations
# if you are looking for detailed descriptions for various paramters.
